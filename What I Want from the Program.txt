I don't know what I want to do after this program. The first thing that comes to mind is working at a studio like From Software,
CD Project Red, Larian or Nintendo. The only problem is that these studios are not in Utah and moving out of Utah is among the last choices on my
mind. They are also very popular studios so employment is tough.

Game studios in Utah:
-Avalanche Software (currently working on HP RPG)
-Red Games Co. (Apps and VR games for families)
-WildWorks (Apps)
-React Games (Apps, educational games, and web)
-Big Finish Games (action adventure PC games)
-Parallel Plaid (Mobile)
-Strange Reptile(Games and Interactive entertainment)
-Tiered World Studios (Stem educational games)
-Ninjabee (PC, Console, and Mobile games)
-Snowcastle Games (Mobile)
-Eat Sleep Play(moved to mobile)

Larian locations:
-Dublin
-Gent
-Kuala Lumpur

CD Project Red Locations:
-Warsaw, Poland
-Cracow, Poland
-Warclaw, Poland





On the Movie side:

Working for DreamWorks, Illumination, Blue Sky, Pixar, Funimation, and Sony Pictures(Imageworks(This is the choice of the two I'd make) and Animation). 
Would be awesome. I would like to do the special effects whether it is for animations or for live action movies. I used to prefer live action movies and 
now I think I wouldn't mind doing either.
